INTRODUCTION
Human beings are so curious about things 
around them. Things around us are related to 
one another. Some bodies are at rest and some 
are in motion. Rest and motion are interrelated 
terms.
In the previous classes you have learnt 
about various types of motion such as linear 
motion, circular motion, oscillatory motion, 
and so on. So far, you have discussed the motion 
of bodies in terms of their displacement, 
velocity, and acceleration. In this unit, let us 
investigate the cause of motion. 
When a body is at rest, starts moving, a 
question that arises in our mind is ‘what causes 
the body to move?’ Similarly, when a moving 
object comes to rest, you would like to know 
what brings it to rest? If a moving object speeds 
up or slows down or changes its  direction. 
what speeds up or slows down the body? What 
changes the direction of motion?
One answer for all the above questions 
is ‘Force’. In a common man’s understanding 
of motion, a body needs a ‘push’ or ‘pull’ to 
move, or bring to rest or change its velocity. 
Hence, this ‘push’ or ‘pull’ is called as ‘force’.
Let us define force in a more scientific 
manner using the three laws proposed by 
Sir Isaac Newton. These laws help you to 
understand the motion of a body and also to 
predict the future course of its motion, if you 
know the forces acting on it. Before Newton 
formulated his three laws of motion, a different 
perception about the force and motion of 
bodies prevailed. Let us first look at these ideas 
and then eventually learn about Newton’s laws 
in this unit.

10th Standard Science
Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with 
the eff ect of force on bodies. It is divided into two 
branches, namely, statics and dynamics.
Statics: It deals with the bodies, which are at 
rest under the action of forces.  
Dynamics: It is the study of moving bodies 
under the action of forces. Dynamics is further 
divided as follows.
Kinematics: It deals with the motion of bodies 
without considering the cause of motion.
Kinetics: It deals with the motion of bodies 
considering the cause of motion.
 1.1  FORCE AND MOTION
According to Aristotle a Greek Philosopher 
and Scientist, the natural state of earthly 
bodies is ‘rest’. He stated that a moving 
body naturally comes to rest  without  any 
external infl uence of the force. Such motions 
are 
termed 
as 
‘natural motion’ (Force 
independent). He also proposed that a force 
(a push or a pull) is needed to make the bodies to 
move from their natural state (rest) and behave 
contrary to their own natural state called as 
‘violent motion’ (Force dependent). Further, he 
said, when two diff ernt mass bodies are dropped 
from a height, the heavier body falls faster than 
the lighter one.
Galileo proposed the following concepts 
about force, motion and inertia of bodies:
(i)
Th e natural state of all earthly bodies
is either the state of rest or the state of 
uniform motion.
(ii)
A body in motion will continue to be in
the same state of motion as long as no
external force is applied.
(iii) When a force is applied on bodies, they
resist any change in their state. Th is
property of bodies is called ‘inertia’.
(iv) When dropped from a height in vacuum,
bodies of diff erent size, shape and mass
fall at the same rate and reach the ground
at the same time.
 1.2  INERTIA 
While you are travelling in a bus or in a car, 
when a sudden brake is applied, the upper part of 
your body leans in the forward direction. Similarly, 
when the vehicle suddenly is move forward from 
rest, you lean backward. Th is is due to, any body 
would like to continue to be in its state of rest or 
the state of motion. Th is is known as ‘inertia’.
Th e inherent property of a body to resist 
any change in its state of rest or the state of 
uniform motion, unless it is infl uenced upon 
by an external unbalanced force, is known as 
‘inertia’.
 Activity 1
Take a glass tumbler and place a small 
cardboard on it as shown in the fi gure. Now, 
keep a coin at the centre of the cardboard. 
Th en, fl ick the cardboard quickly. What do 
you observe?
Th e cardboard falls off  the ground and 
the coin falls into the glass tumbler.
Inertia of rest
In activity described above, the inertia of 
the coin keeps it in the state of rest when the 
cardboard moves. Th en, when the cardboard 
has moved, the coin falls into the tumbler due 
to gravity. Th is happen due to ‘inertia of rest’.
1.2.1 Types of Inertia

Inertia of rest: Th e
resistance of a body to
change its state of rest
is called inertia of rest.

Laws of motion
 1.4   NEWTON’S LAWS OF 
MOTION
1.4.1 Newton’s First Law
This law states that every body continues 
to be in its state of rest or the state of uniform 
motion along a straight line unless it is acted 
upon by some external force. It gives the 
definition of force as well as inertia.
1.4.2 Force
Force is an external effort in the form of 
push or pull, which:  
1. produces or tries to produce the motion of
a static body.
2. stops or tries to stop a moving body.
3. changes or tries to change the direction of
motion of  a moving body.
Force has both magnitude and direction.
So, it is a vector quantity.
1.4.3 Types of forces
Based on the direction in which the forces 
act, they can be classified into two types as: 
(a) Like parallel forces and (b) Unlike parallel
forces.
(a) Like parallel forces: Two or more forces of
equal or unequal magnitude acting along
the same direction, parallel to each other
are called like parallel forces.
(b) Unlike parallel forces: If two or more equal
forces or unequal forces act along opposite
directions parallel to each other, then they
are called unlike parallel forces. Action of
forces are given in Table 1.1.
1.4.4 Resultant Force
When several forces act simultaneously on 
the same body, then the combined effect of the 
multiple forces can be represented by a single 
force, which is termed as ‘resultant force’. It is 
equal to the vector sum (adding the magnitude 
of the forces with their direction) of all the forces.
change its state of motion is called inertia 
of motion.
c)
Inertia of direction: The resistance of a
body to change its direction of motion is
called inertia of direction.
1.2.2 Examples of Inertia 
 An athlete runs some distance before
jumping. Because, this will help him jump
longer and higher. (Inertia of motion)
 When you make a sharp turn while driving
a car, you tend to lean sideways, (Inertia of
direction).
 When you vigorously shake the branches
of a tree, some of the leaves and fruits are
detached and they fall down, (Inertia of rest).
Figure 1.1 Inertia of motion
 1.3  LINEAR MOMENTUM
The impact of a force is more if the 
velocity and the mass of the body is more. To 
quantify the impact of a force exactly, a new 
physical quantity known as linear momentum 
is defined. The linear momentum measures the 
impact of a force on a body. 
The product of mass and velocity of a 
moving body gives the magnitude of linear 
momentum. It acts in the direction of the 
velocity of the object. Linear momentum is a 
vector quantity. 
Linear Momentum = mass × velocity
p = m v . . . . . . . . . .(1.1)
It helps to measure the magnitude of 
a force. Unit of momentum in SI system is 
kg m s–1 and in C.G.S system its unit is g cm s-1.

10th Standard Science
If the resultant force of all the forces 
acting on a body is equal to zero, then the body 
will be in equilibrium. Such forces are called 
balanced forces. If the resultant force is not 
equal to zero, then it causes the motion of the 
body due to unbalanced forces 
Examples: Drawing water from a well, force 
applied with a crow bar, forces on a weight 
balance, etc.
A system can be brought to equilibrium 
by applying another force, which is equal to the 
resultant force in magnitude, but opposite in 
direction. Such force is called as ‘Equilibrant’.
1.4.5  Rotating Effect of Force
Have you observed the position of the 
handle in a door? It is always placed at the 
edge of door and not at some other place. 
Why? Have you tried to push a door by 
placing your hand closer to the hinges or the 
fixed edge? What do you observe? 
The door can be easily opened or closed 
when you apply the force at a point far away 
from the fixed edge. In this case, the effect 
of the force you apply is to turn the door 
about the fixed edge. This turning effect of 
the applied force is more when the distance 
between the fixed edge and the point of 
application of force is more.

The axis of the fixed edge about which 
the door is rotated is called as the ‘axis of

Laws of motion
The rod will be turned about the fixed point 
is called as ‘point of rotation’. 
1.4.6 Moment of the Force
The rotating or turning effect of a force 
about a fixed point or fixed axis is called 
moment of the force about that point or 
torque (τ). It is measured by the product 
of the force (F) and the perpendicular 
distance (d) between the fixed point or 
the fixed axis and the line of action of the 
force. 
τ = F × d . . . . . . . . . . (1.2)
Torque is a vector quantity. It is acting 
along the direction, perpendicular to the 
plane containing the line of action of force 
and the distance. Its SI unit is N m.
Couple: Two equal and unlike parallel forces 
applied simultaneously at two distinct points 
constitute a couple. The line of action of the 
two forces does not coincide. It does not 
produce any translatory motion since the 
resultant is zero. But, a couple results in causes 
the rotation of the body. Rotating effect of a 
couple is known as moment of a couple.
Examples: Turning a tap, winding or 
unwinding a screw, spinning of a top, etc.
Moment of a couple is measured by 
the product of any one of the forces and the 
perpendicular distance between the line of 
action of two forces. The turning effect of a 
couple is measured by the magnitude of its 
moment.
Moment of a couple =  Force × perpendicular 
distance between the 
line of action of forces
M = F × S . . . . . . . . . . . . (1.3)
The unit of moment of a couple is newton 
metre (N m) in SI system and dyne cm in 
CGS system. 
By convention, the direction of moment of 
a force or couple is taken as positive if the body 
is rotated in the anti-clockwise direction and 
negative if it is rotate in the clockwise direction. 
They are shown in Figures 1.4 (a and b)

1.4.7 Application of Torque 
1. Gears:
A gear is a circular 
wheel with teeth around its 
rim. It helps to change the 
speed of rotation of a wheel 
by changing the torque and 
helps to transmit power.
2. Seasaw
Most of you have played on the seasaw. 
Since there is a difference in the weight of the 
persons sitting on it, the heavier person lifts 
the lighter person. When the heavier person 
comes closer to the pivot point (fulcrum) 
the distance of the line of action of the force 
decreases. It causes less amount of torque to 
act on it. This enables the lighter person to lift 
the heavier person.
3. Steering Wheel
A small steering wheel enables you to
manoeuore a car easily by transferring a 
torque to the wheels with less effort.
1.4.8 Principle of Moments
When a number of like or unlike parallel 
forces act on a rigid body and the body is in 
equilibrium, then the algebraic sum of the 
moments in the clockwise direction is equal 
to the algebraic sum of the moments in the 
anticlockwise direction. In other words, at

of all the individual forces about any point is 
equal to zero.

In the illustration given in figure 1.5, the 
force F1 produces an anticlockwise rotation at 
a distance d1 from the point of pivot P (called 
fulcrum) and the force F2 produces a clockwise 
rotation at a distance d2 from the point of pivot 
P. The principle of moments can be written as
follows:
Moment in 
clockwise direction = Moment in
anticlockwise direction
F1 × d1 =  F2 × d2  . . . . . . . . (1.4)
 1.5   NEWTON’S SECOND LAW 
OF MOTION
According to this law, “the force acting 
on a body is directly proportional to the rate 
of change of linear momentum of the body 
and the change in momentum takes place in 
the direction of the force”.
This law helps us to measure the amount 
of force. So, it is also called as ‘law of force’. 
Let, ‘m’ be the mass of a moving body, moving 
along a straight line with an initial speed ‘u’ 
After a time interval of ‘t’, the velocity of the 
body changes to ‘v’ due to the impact of an 
unbalanced external force F.
Initial momentum of the body Pi = mu
Final momentum of the body Pf = mv 
Change in momentum 
Δp = Pf –Pi 
 = mv  –  mu
By Newton’s second law of motion, 
Force, F ∝ rate of change of momentum
F ∝ change in momentum / time
F ∝ mv – mu
t
F = km(v – u)
t
Here, k is the proportionality constant. 
k = 1 in all systems of units. Hence,
F = m(v – u)
(1.5)
t
Since, acceleration = change in velocity/
time, a=(v-u)/t. Hence, we have
F = m × a  
 (1.6)
Force = mass × acceleration
No external force is required to maintain 
the motion of a body moving with uniform 
velocity. When the net force acting on a 
body is not equal to zero, then definitely the 
velocity of the body will change. Thus, change 
in momentum takes place in the direction of 
the force. The change may take place either in 
magnitude or in direction or in both.  
Force 
is 
required 
to 
produce 
the 
acceleration of a body. In a uniform circular 
motion, even though the speed (magnitude of 
velocity) remains constant, the direction of the 
velocity changes at every point on the circular 
path. So, the acceleration is produced along 
the radius called as centripetal acceleration. 
The force, which produces this acceleration 
is called as centripetal force, about which you 
have learnt in class IX. 
Units of force: SI unit of force is newton (N)
and in C.G.S system its unit is dyne.
Definition of 1 newton (N):  The amount of 
force required for a body of mass 1 kg produces 
an acceleration of 1 m s
–2, 1 N = 1 kg m s
–2
Definition of  1 dyne: The amount of force 
required for a body of mass 1 gram produces 
an acceleration of 1 cm s
–2, 1 dyne = 1 g cm s
–2; 
also 1 N = 10
5 dyne.

Laws of motion
Unit force:
The amount of force required to produce 
an acceleration of 1 m s
–2 in a body of mass 
1 kg is called ‘unit force’.
Gravitational unit of force:
In the SI system of units, gravitational 
unit of force is kilogram force, represented by 
kg f. In the CGS system its unit is gram force, 
represented by g f.
1 kg f = 1 kg × 9.8 m s
-2 = 9.8 N;
1 g f = 1 g × 980 cm s
-2 = 980 dyne
 1.6  Impulse
A large force acting for a very short 
interval of time is called as ‘Impulsive force’. 
When a force F acts on a body for a period of 
time t, then the product of force and time is 
known as ‘impulse’ represented by ‘J’
Impulse, J = F × t 
(1.7)
By Newton’s second law
F = Δp / t  (Δ refers to change)
Δp = F × t 
(1.8)
From 1.7 and 1.8
J = Δp
Impulse is also equal to the magnitude of 
change in momentum. Its unit is kg m s–1 or N s.
Change in momentum can be achieved in 
two ways. They are: 
i.
 a large force acting for a short period of
time and
ii.  a smaller force acting for a longer period
of time.
Examples:
  Automobiles are fitted with springs and
shock absorbers to reduce jerks while
moving on uneven roads.
 In cricket, a fielder pulls back his hands
while catching the ball. He experiences
a smaller force for a longer interval of
time to catch the ball, resulting in a lesser
impulse on his hands.
Figure 1.6 Example of impulsive force
1.7   NEWTON’S THIRD LAW 
OF MOTION
Newton’s third law states that ‘for every 
action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
They always act on two different bodies’.
If a body A applies a force FA on a body 
B, then the body B reacts with force FB on the 
body A, which is equal to FA in magnitude, but 
opposite in direction. FB = –FA 
Examples:
 When birds fly they push the air
downwards with their wings (Action)
and the air pushes the bird upwards
(Reaction).
 When a person swims he pushes the water
using the hands backwards (Action), and
the water pushes the swimmer in the
forward direction (Reaction).
 When you fire a bullet, the gun recoils
backward and the bullet is moving
forward (Action) and the gun equalises
this forward action by moving backward
(Reaction).
1.8   PRINCIPLE OF 
CONSERVATION OF LINEAR 
MOMENTUM
There is no change in 
the linear momentum of a 
system of bodies as long as 
no net external force acts on 
them.

10th Standard Science
filled with a fuel (either liquid or solid) in the 
propellant tank. When the rocket is fired, this 
fuel is burnt and a hot gas is ejected with a high 
speed from the nozzle of the rocket, producing 
a huge momentum. To balance this momentum, 
an equal and opposite reaction force is produced 
in the combustion chamber, which makes the 
rocket project forward.
While in motion, the mass of the rocket 
gradually decreases, until the fuel is completely 
burnt out. Since, there is no net external force 
acting on it, the linear momentum of the 
system is conserved. The mass of the rocket 
decreases with altitude, which results in the 
gradual increase in velocity of the rocket. 
At one stage, it reaches a velocity, which is 
sufficient to just escape from the gravitational 
pull of the Earth. This velocity is called escape 
velocity. (This topic will be discussed in detail 
in higher classes).
1.10  GRAVITATION
1.10.1  Newton’s universal law of 
gravitation
This law states that every particle of 
matter in this universe attracts every other 
particle with a force. This force is directly 
proportional to the product of their masses 
and inversely proportional to the square of 
the distance between the centers of these 
masses. The direction of the force acts along 
the line joining the masses. 
Force between the masses is always 
attractive and it does not depend on the 
medium where they are placed.

linear momentum
Proof:
Let two bodies A and B having masses 
m1 and m2 move with initial velocity u1 and u2 
in a straight line. Let the velocity of the first 
body be higher than that of the second body. 
i.e., u1>u2.  During an interval of time t second,
they tend to have a collision.  After the impact,
both of them move along the same straight line
with a velocity v1 and v2 respectively.
Force on body B due to A,
FB= m2 (v2–u2)/t
Force on body A due to B,
FA = m1 (v1–u1)/t
By Newton’s III law of motion, 
Action force =  Reaction force
FA 
= –FB 
m1 (v1-u1)/t  
= –m2 (v2-u2)/t  
m1v1 + m2v2 = m1u1 + m2u2  ------ (1.9) 
The above equation confirms in the 
absence of an external force, the algebraic 
sum of the momentum after collision is 
numerically equal to the algebraic sum of the 
momentum before collision. 
Hence the law of conservation linear 
momentum is proved.
 1.9  ROCKET PROPULSION
Propulsion of rockets is based on the law 
of conservation of linear momentum as well 
as Newton’s III law of motion. Rockets are

1.10.2  Acceleration due to 
gravity (g)
When you throw any object upwards, its 
velocity ceases at a particular height and then 
it falls down due to the gravitational force of 
the Earth.
The velocity of the object keeps changing 
as it falls down. This change in velocity must 
be due to the force acting on the object. The 
acceleration of the body is due to the Earth’s 
gravitational force. So, it is called as ‘acceleration 
due to the gravitational force of the Earth’ or 
‘acceleration due to gravity of the Earth’. It is 
represented as ‘g’. Its unit is m s
–2 
Mean value of the acceleration due to 
gravity is taken as 9.8 m s
–2 on the surface of the 
Earth. This means that the velocity of a body 
during the downward free fall motion varies 
by 9.8 m s
–1 for every 1 second.  However, the 
value of ‘g’ is not the same at all points on the 
surface of the earth.
1.10.3 Relation between g and G
When a body is at rests on the surface of 
the Earth, it is acted upon by the gravitational 
force of the Earth. Let us compute the 
magnitude of this force in two ways. Let, M 
be the mass of the Earth and m be the mass 
of the body.  The entire mass of the Earth is 
assumed to be concentrated at its centre. The 
radius of the Earth is R = 6378 km (= 6400 km 
approximately). By Newton’s law of gravitation, 
the force acting on the body is given by
F = 
G M m
R

Here, the radius of the body considered 
is negligible when compared with the Earth’s 
radius. Now, the same force can be obtained 
from Newton’s second law of motion. 
According to this law, the force acting on 
the body is given by the product of its mass 
and acceleration (called as weight). Here, 
acceleration of the body is under the action 
of gravity hence a = g
F = m a = m g
F = weight = mg  -------------------  (1.12)
Comparing equations (1.7) and (1.8), we get
mg = GMm

1.10.4 Mass of the Earth (M)
Rearranging the equation (1.14), the mass 
of the Earth is obtained as follows: 
Mass of the Earth M = g R
2/G
Substituting the known values of g, R and G, 
you can calculate the mass of the Earth as
M = 5.972 × 10
24 kg

1.10.5  Variation of acceleration 
due to gravity (g):
Since, g depends on the geometric radius 
of the Earth, (g ∝ 1/R
2), its value changes 
from one place to another on the surface of 
the Earth. Since, the geometric radius of the 
Earth is maximum in the equatorial region and 
minimum in the polar region, the value of g is 
maximum in the polar region and minimum at 
the equatorial region. 
When you move to a higher altitude from 
the surface of the Earth, the value of g reduces. 
In the same way, when you move deep below 
the surface of the Earth, the value of g reduces. 
(This topic will be discussed in detail in the 
higher classes). Value of g  is zero at the centre 
of the Earth.
 1.11  MASS AND WEIGHT
Mass: Mass is the basic property of a body. 
Mass of a body is defined as the quantity of 
matter contained in the body. Its SI unit is 
kilogram (kg). 
Weight: Weight of a body is defined as the 
gravitational force exerted on it due to the 
Earth’s gravity alone.
Weight = Gravitational Force
=  mass (m)× acceleration due to 
gravity(g).
g = acceleration due to gravity for Earth 
(at sea level) = 9.8 m s
–2.
Weight is a vector quantity. Direction 
of weight is always towards the centre of 
the Earth. SI unit of weight is newton (N). 
Weight of a body varies from one place to 
another place on the Earth since it depends 
on the acceleration due to gravity of the 
Earth (g) weight of a body is more at the poles 
than at the equatorial region. 
The value of acceleration due to gravity 
on the surface of the moon is 1.625 ms–2. This 
is about 0.1654 times the acceleration due to 
gravity of the Earth. If a person whose mass 
is 60 kg stands on the surface of Earth, his 
weight would be 588 N (W = mg = 60 × 9.8). 
If the same person goes to the surface of the 
Moon, he would weigh only 97.5 N (W = 60 
× 1.625). But, his mass remains the same (60 
kg) on both the Earth and the Moon.
1.12  APPARENT WEIGHT
The weight that you 
feel to possess during up 
and down motion, is not 
same as your actual weight. 
Apparent weight is the 
weight of the body acquired 
due to the action of gravity 
and other external forces 
acting on the body.
Let us see this from the 
following illustration:
Let us consider a person of mass m, who 
is travelling in lift. The actual weight of the 
person is W = mg, which is acting vertically 
downwards. The reaction force exerted by the 
lift’s surface ‘R’, taken as apparent weight is 
acting vertically upwards.
Let us see different possibilities of the 
apparent weight 'R' of the person that arise, 
depending on the motion of the lift; upwards 
or downwards  which are given in Table 1.2
1.12.1 Weightlessness
Have you gone to an 
amusement park and taken 
a ride in a roller coaster? or 
in a giant wheel? During 
the fast downward and 
upward movement, how 
did you feel?

Laws of motion
Table 1.2 Apparent weight of a person in a moving lift
Case 1: Lift 
is moving 
upward with an 
acceleration 'a'
Case 2: Lift 
is moving 
downward with 
an acceleration 'a'
Case 3: Lift is at rest.
Case 4: Lift is falling down 
freely
R – W = Fnet = ma
R = W + ma
R = mg + ma
R = m(g+a)  
W – R = Fnet = ma
R = W - ma  
R = mg - ma
R = m(g-a)
Here, the acceleration is zero 
a = 0
R = W 
R= mg
Here, the acceleration is 
equal to g 
a = g
R = m(g – g) 
R > W
R < W
R = W
R = 0
Apparent weight  
is greater than the 
actual weight.
Apparent weight 
is lesser than the 
actual weight.
Apparent weight is equal 
to the actual weight.
Apparent weight is equal 
to zero.
Figure 1.11 Weightlessness in a roller coaster
Its amazing!!. You actually feel as if you are 
falling freely without having any weight. This is 
due to the phenomenon of ‘weightlessness’. You 
seem to have lost your weight when you move 
down with a certain acceleration. Sometimes, 
you experience the same feeling while travelling 
in a lift.
When the person in a lift moves down with 
an acceleration (a) equal to the acceleration due 
to gravity (g), i.e., when a = g, this motion is 
called as ‘free fall’. Here, the apparent weight 
(R = m (g – g) = 0) of the person is zero. 
This condition or state refers to the state of 
weightlessness. (Refer case 4 from Table 1.2). 
The same effect takes place while falling 
freely in a roller coaster or on a swing or in a 
vertical giant wheel. You feel an apparent weight 
loss and weight gain when you are moving up 
and down in such rides.
1.12.2  Weightlessness of 
the astronauts
Some of us believe that the astronauts in 
the orbiting spacestation do not experience 
any gravitational force of the Earth. So they 
float. But this is absolutely wrong. 
Astronauts are not floating but falling 
freely around the earth due to their huge 
oribital velocity. Since spacestation and 
astronauts have equal acceleration, they are 
under free fall condition. (R  = 0 refer case 
4 in Table 1.2). Hence, both the astronauts 
and the spacestation are in the state of 
weightlessness.

1.12.3  Application of Newton’s 
law of gravitation
1)  Dimensions of the heavenly bodies can be
measured using the gravitation law. Mass of
the Earth, radius of the Earth, acceleration
due to gravity, etc. can be calculated with a
higher accuracy.
2)  Helps in discovering new stars and planets.
3)  One of the irregularities in the motion
of stars is called ‘Wobble’ lead to the
disturbance in the motion of a planet nearby.
In this condition the mass of the star can be
calculated using the law of gravitation.
4)  Helps to explain germination of roots is due
to the property of geotropism which is the
property of a root responding to the gravity.
5)  Helps to predict the path of the astronomical
bodies.
Points to Remember

 Mechanics is divided into statics and
dynamics.

 Ability of a body to maintain its state of
rest or motion is called Inertia.

 Moment of the couple is measured by
the product of any one of the forces and
the perpendicular distance between two
forces.

 SI unit of force is newton (N). C.G.S unit
is dyne.

 When a force F acts on a body for a period
of time t, then the product of force and
time is known as ‘impulse’.

 The unit of weight is newton or kg f

 The weight of a body  is more at the poles
than at the equatorial region.

 Mass of a body is defined as the quantity of
matter contained in the object. Its SI unit
is kilogram (kg).

 Apparent weight is the weight of the body
acquired due to the action of gravity and
other external forces on the body.

 Whenever a body or a person falls freely
under the action of Earth’s gravitational
force alone, it appears to have zero
weight. This state is referred to as
‘weightlessness’.
SOLVED PROBLEMS 
Problem-1: Calculate the velocity of a moving 
body of mass 5 kg whose linear momentum is 
2.5 kg m s–1.
Solution: Linear momentum = mass × velocity
Velocity = linear momentum / mass. 
V = 2.5 / 5 = 0.5 m s–1
Problem 2: A door is pushed, at a point whose 
distance from the hinges is 90 cm, with a force 
of 40 N. Calculate the moment of the force 
about the hinges.
Solution:   
Formula: The moment of a force M = F × d
Given: F = 40 N and d = 90 cm = 0.9 m.
Hence, moment of the force = 40 × 0.9 = 36 N m.

the Earth the acceleration due to gravity will be 
1/4
th of its value as at the Earth.

INTRODUCTION 
Light is a form of energy which travels in 
the form of waves. Th e path of light is called 
ray of light and group of these rays are called 
as beam of light. Any object which gives out 
light are termed as source of light. Some of the 
sources emit their own light and they are called 
as luminous objects.  All the stars, including 
the Sun, are examples for luminous objects. 
We all know that we are able to see objects with 
the help of our eyes. But, we cannot see any 
object in a dark room. Can you explain why? 
If your answer is ‘we need light to see objects’, 
the next question is ‘if you make the light from 
a torch to fall on your eyes, will you be able to 
see the objects?’ Defi nitely, ‘NO’. We can see 
the objects only when the light is made to fall 
on the objects and the light refl ected from the 
objects is viewed by our eyes. You would have 
studied about the refl ection and refraction of 
light elaborately in your previous classes. In this 
chapter, we shall discuss about the scattering 
of light, images formed by convex and concave 
lenses, human eye and optical instruments 
such as telescopes and microscopes.
 2.1  PROPERTIES OF LIGHT
Let us recall the properties of light and the 
important aspects on refraction of light. 
1. Light is a form of energy.
2. Light always travels along a straight line.
3. Light does not need any medium for its
propagation. It can even travel through
vacuum.
4. Th e speed of light in vacuum or air is,
c = 3 × 108 ms–1.
5. Since, light is in the form of waves, it is
characterized by a wavelength (λ) and
a frequency (ν), which are related by the
following equation: c = ν λ (c - velocity of
light).
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
 state the laws of refraction.
 list the properties of light.
 explain the scattering of light and its various kinds.
 understand the images formed by concave and convex lens.
 analyze the ray diagram of concave and convex lens.
 understand the working of human eye and optical instruments
 solve numerical problems

6. Different coloured light has different
wavelength and frequency.
7. Among the visible light, violet light has the
lowest wavelength and red light has the
highest wavelength.
8. When light is incident on the interface
between two media, it is partly reflected
and partly refracted.
 2.2  REFRACTION OF LIGHT
When a ray of light travels from one 
transparent medium into another obliquely, 
the path of the  light undergoes deviation. This 
deviation of ray of light is called refraction. 
Refraction takes place due to the difference 
in the velocity of light in different media. The 
velocity of light is more in a rarer medium and 
less in a denser medium. Refraction of light 
obeys two laws of refraction.
2.2.1 First law of refraction:
The incident ray, the refracted ray of light 
and the normal to the refracting surface all lie 
in the same plane.
2.2.2 Second law of refraction:
The ratio of the sine of the angle of 
incidence and sine of the angle of refraction 
is equal to the ratio of refractive indices of the 
two media. This law is also known as Snell’s law.

 . . . . . . . . . . . (2.1)
 Refractive index gives us an idea of how
fast or how slow light travels in a medium.
The ratio of speed of light in vacuum to
the speed of light in a medium is defined
as refractive index ‘µ’ of that medium.
 The speed of light in a medium is low if the
refractive index of the medium is high and
vice versa.
 When light travels from a denser medium
into a rarer medium, the refracted ray is
bent away from the normal drawn to the
interface.
 When light travels from a rarer medium
into a denser medium, the refracted ray
is bent towards the normal drawn to the
interface.
 2.3   REFRACTION OF A 
COMPOSITE LIGHT-
DISPERSION OF LIGHT
We know that Sun is the fundamental 
and natural source of light. If a source of light 
produces a light of single colour, it is known as 
a monochromatic source. On the other hand, 
a composite source of light produces a white 
light which contains light of different colours. 
Sun light is a composite light which consists 
of light of various colours or wavelengths. 
Another example for a composite source is a 
mercury vapour lamp. What do you observe 
when a white light is refracted through a glass 
prism? 
When a beam of white light or composite 
light is refracted through any transparent 
media such as glass or water, it is split into 
its component colours. This phenomenon is 
called as ‘dispersion of light’.
The band of colours is termed as spectrum. 
This spectrum consists of following colours: 
Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, 
and Red. These colours are represented by 
the acronym “VIBGYOR”. Why do we get 
the spectrum when white light is refracted 
by a transparent medium? This is because, 
different coloured lights are bent through 
different angles. That is the angle of refraction 
is different for different colours. 
Angle of refraction is the smallest for 
red and the highest for violet. From Snell’s 
law, we know that the angle of refraction is 
determined in terms of the refractive index 
of the medium. Hence, the refractive index of 
the medium is different for different coloured 
lights. This indicates that the refractive index 
of a medium is dependent on the wavelength 
of the light.

 2.4  SCATTERING OF LIGHT
When 
sunlight 
enters 
the 
Earth’s 
atmosphere, the atoms and molecules of 
different gases present in the atmosphere 
refract the light in all possible directions. 
This is called as ‘Scattering of light’.  In this 
phenomenon, the beam of light is redirected in 
all directions when it interacts with a particle 
of medium. The interacting particle of the 
medium is called as ‘scatterer’.
Figure 2.1 Scattering of light
2.4.1 Types of scattering
When a beam of light, interacts with 
a constituent particle of the medium, it 
undergoes many kinds of scattering. Based 
on initial and final energy of the light beam, 
scattering can be classified as, 
1) Elastic scattering 2) Inelastic scattering
1) Elastic scattering
If the energy of the incident beam of light
and the scattered beam of light are same, then 
it is called as ‘elastic scattering’.
2) Inelastic scattering
If the energy of the incident beam of
light and the scattered beam of light are not 
same, then it is called as ‘inelastic scattering’.
The nature and size of the scatterer results in 
different types of scattering. They are
• Rayleigh scattering
• Mie scattering
• Tyndall scattering
• Raman scattering
Rayleigh scattering
The scattering of sunlight by the atoms 
or molecules of the gases in the earth’s 
atmosphere is known as Rayleigh scattering.
 Rayleigh’s scattering law
Rayleigh’s scattering law states that, “The 
amount of scattering of light is inversely 
proportional to the fourth power of its 
wavelength”. 
Amount of scattering ‘S’  ∝    1
 λ4
According to this law, the shorter 
wavelength colours are scattered much more 
than the longer wavelength colours.
When sunlight passes through the 
atmosphere, 
the 
blue 
colour 
(shorter 
wavelength) is scattered to a greater extent 
than the red colour (longer wavelength). This 
scattering causes the sky to appear in blue 
colour.
At sunrise and sunset, the light rays from 
the Sun have to travel a larger distance in the 
atmosphere than at noon. Hence, most of the 
blue lights are scattered away and only the 
red light which gets least scattered reaches 
us. Therefore, the colour of the Sun is red at 
sunrise and sunset.
 Mie scattering
Mie scattering takes place when the 
diameter of the scatterer is similar to or larger 
than the wavelength of the incident light. It 
is also an elastic scattering. The amount of 
scattering is independent of wave length.
Mie scattering is caused by pollen, dust, 
smoke, water droplets, and other particles in 
the lower portion of the atmosphere.
Mie scattering is responsible for the 
white appearance of the clouds. When white 
light falls on the water drop, all the colours 
are equally scattered which together form the 
white light.

Optics
Tyndall Scattering
When a beam of sunlight, enters into a 
dusty room through a window, then its path 
becomes visible to us. This is because, the tiny 
dust particles present in the air of the room 
scatter the beam of light. This is an example of 
Tyndall Scattering 
The scattering of light rays by the 
colloidal particles in the colloidal solution is 
called Tyndall Scattering or Tyndall Effect.
Do you Know
Colloid is a microscopically small substance 
that is equally dispersed throughout another 
material. Example: Milk, Ice cream, muddy 
water, smoke
 Raman scattering
When a parallel beam of monochromatic 
(single coloured ) light passes through a gas or 
liquid or transparent solid, a part of light  rays 
are  scattered.
The scattered light contains some additional 
frequencies (or wavelengths) other than that 
of incident frequency (or wavelength). This is 
known as Raman scattering or Raman Effect. 
Raman Scattering is defined as “The 
interaction of light ray with the particles of pure 
liquids or transparent solids, which leads to a 
change in wavelength or frequency.”
The spectral lines having frequency 
equal to the incident ray frequency is called 
‘Rayleigh line’ and the spectral lines which are 
having frequencies other than the incident ray 
frequency are called ‘Raman lines’. The lines 
having frequencies lower than the incident 
frequency is called stokes lines and the lines 
having frequencies higher than the incident 
frequency are called Antistokes lines. 
You will study more about Raman Effect 
in higher classes.
 2.5  LENSES
A lens is an optically transparent medium 
bounded by two spherical refracting surfaces 
or one plane and one spherical surface.
Lens is basically classified into two types. 
They are: (i) Convex Lens (ii) Concave Lens
(i) Convex or bi-convex lens: It is a lens
bounded by two spherical surfaces such
that it is thicker at the centre than at the
edges. A beam of light passing through it,
is converged to a point. So, a convex lens is
also called as converging lens.
(ii) Concave or bi-concave Lens: It is a lens
bounded by two spherical surfaces such
that it is thinner at the centre than at the
edges. A parallel beam of light passing
through it, is diverged or spread out. So, a
concave lens is also called as diverging lens.
2.5.1 Other types of Lenses
Plano-convex lens: If one of the faces of a 
bi-convex lens is plane, it is known as a plano-
convex lens. 
Plano-concave lens: If one of the faces 
of a bi-concave lens is plane, it is known as a 
plano-concave lens. 
All these lenses are shown in Figure 2.2 
given below:

 2.6   IMAGES FORMED DUE TO 
REFRACTION THROUGH 
A CONVEX AND CONCAVE 
LENS
When an object is placed in front of a 
lens, the light rays from the object fall on the 
lens. Th e position, size and nature of the image 
formed can be understood only if we know 
certain basic rules.
Rule-1: When a ray of light strikes the 
convex or concave lens obliquely at its optical 
centre, it continues to follow its path without 
any deviation (Figure 2.3).
Figure 2.3 Rays passing through the 
optical centre
Rule-2: When rays parallel to the principal axis 
strikes a convex or concave lens, the refracted 
rays are converged to (convex lens) or appear 
to diverge from (concave lens) the principal 
focus (Figure 2.4).
Figure 2.4 Rays passing parallel to the optic 
axis
Rule-3: When a ray passing through (convex 
lens) or directed towards (concave lens) the 
principal focus strikes a convex or concave 
lens, the refracted ray will be parallel to the 
principal axis (Figure 2.5).
Figure 2.5 Rays passing through or directed 
towards the principal focus
 2.7   REFRACTION THROUGH A 
CONVEX LENS
Let 
us 
discuss 
the 
formation of images by 
a convex lens when the 
object is placed at various 
positions.
Object at infi nity
When an object is placed at infi nity, a real 
image is formed at the principal focus. Th e size 
of the image is much smaller than that of the 
object (Figure 2.6).
Figure 2.6 Object at infi nity
Object placed beyond C (>2F)
When an object is placed behind the 
center of curvature(beyond C), a real and 
inverted image is formed between the center 
of curvature and the principal focus. Th e size 
of the image is the same as that of the object 
(Figure 2.7).
Figure 2.7 Object placed beyond C (>2F)
 Object placed at C
When an object is placed at the center of 
curvature, a real and inverted image is formed 
at the other center of curvature. Th e size of 
the image is the same as that of the object 
(Figure 2.8).

center of curvature. The size of the image is 
bigger than that of the object (Figure 2.9).

When an object is placed at the focus, 
a real image is formed at infinity. The size

telescope and slide projectors

called hypermetropia
 2.9   REFRACTION THROUGH A 
CONCAVE LENS
Let us discuss the formation of images by 
a concave lens when the object is placed at two 
possible positions.
Object at Infinity
When an object is placed at infinity, a 
virtual image is formed at the focus. The size of 
the image is much smaller than that of the object 
(Figure 2.12).

Object anywhere on the principal 
axis at a finite distance
When an object is placed at a finite distance 
from the lens, a virtual image is formed between 
optical center and focus of the concave lens. 
The size of the image is smaller than that of the 
object (Figure 2.13).

But, as the distance between the object 
and the lens is decreased, the distance 
between the image and the lens also keeps 
decreasing. Further, the size of the image 
formed increases as the distance between the 
object and the lens is decreased. This is shown 
in (figure 2.14).

‘Galilean Telescope’
2. They are used in wide angle spy hole in
doors.
3. They are are used to correct the defect of
vision called ‘myopia’
 2.11  LENS FORMULA
Like spherical mirrors, we have lens 
formula for spherical lenses. The lens 
formula gives the relationship among 
distance of the object (u), distance of the 
image (v) and the focal length (f) of the 
lens. It is expressed as
 1 
 f
 =  1 
 v
 −  1 
 u
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.2
It is applicable to both convex and 
concave lenses. We need to give an at most 
care while solving numerical problems 
related to lenses in taking proper signs of 
different quantities.
2.12  SIGN CONVENTION
Cartesian sign conventions are used for 
measuring the various distances in the ray 
diagrams of spherical lenses. According to 
cartesian sign convention,
1. The object is always placed on the left side
of the lens.
2. All the distances are measured from the
optical centre of the lens.
3. The distances measured in the same
direction as that of incident light are taken
as positive.
4. The distances measured against the direction
of incident light are taken as negative.
5. The distances measured upward and
perpendicular to the principal axis is taken
as positive.
6. The distances measured downward and
perpendicular to the principal axis is taken
as negative.
2.13   MAGNIFICATION OF A 
LENS
Like 
spherical 
mirrors, 
we 
have 
magnification for spherical lenses. Spherical 
lenses produce magnification and it is defined 
as the ratio of the height of the image to the 
10th_Science_Unit-2.indd   22
21-02-2019   18:34:37

23
Optics
height of an object. Magnification is denoted 
by the letter ‘m’. If height of the object is h and 
height of the image is h´, the magnification 
produced by lens is,
m =  height of the image
 height of the object  
=  h'
 h 
    …… (2.3)
Also it is related to the distance of the object 
(u) and the distance of the image (v) as follows:
m =  Distance of the image 
 Distance of the object  
 =  v 
 u 
  …… (2.4)
If the magnification is greater than 1, then 
we get an enlarged image. On the other hand, 
if the magnification is less than 1, then we get a 
diminished image. 
 2.14   LENS MAKER’S 
FORMULA
All lenses are made up of transparent 
materials. Any optically transparent material 
will have a refractive index. The lens formula 
relates the focal length of a lens with the distance 
of object and image. For a maker of any lens, 
knowledge of radii of curvature of the lens is 
required. This clearly indicates the need for an 
equation relating the radii of curvature of the 
lens, the refractive index of the given material of 
the lens and the required focal length of the lens. 
The lens maker’s formula is one such equation. 
It is given as
 1 
 f = (µ − 1)  1 
 R1
− 1 
 R2
 . . . . . . . . .(2.5)
where µ is the refractive index of the 
material of the lens; R1 and R2 are the radii of 
curvature of the two faces of the lens; f is the 
focal length of the lens.
 2.15  POWER OF A LENS
When a ray of light falls on a lens, the 
ability to converge or diverge these light rays 
depends on the focal length of the lens. This 
ability of a lens to converge (convex lens) or 
diverge (concave lens) is called as its power. 
Hence, the power of a lens can be defined as the 
degree of convergence or divergence of light 
rays. Power of a lens is numerically defined as 
the reciprocal of its focal length.
P =  1
 f
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .(2.6)
The SI unit of power of a lens is dioptre. It 
is represented by the symbol D. If focal length 
is expressed in ‘m’, then the power of lens is 
expressed in ‘D’. Thus 1D is the power of a lens, 
whose focal length is 1metre. 1D = 1m-1.
By convention, the power of a convex lens 
is taken as positive whereas the power of a 
concave lens is taken, as negative. 
More to Know
The lens formula  and lens maker’s formula 
are applicable to only thin lenses. In the case 
of thick lenses, these formulae with little 
modifications are used.

 2.16  HUMAN EYE
The human eyes are most valuable and 
sensitive organs responsible for vision. They are 
the gateway to the wonderful world. 
Structure of the eye
The eye ball is approximately spherical 
in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. It 
consists of a tough membrane called sclera, 
which protects the internal parts of the eye.
Important parts of human eye are
Cornea: This is the thin and transparent layer 
on the front surface of the eyeball as shown in 
figure 2.15. It is the main refracting surface. 
When light enters through the cornea, it 
refracts or bends the light on to the lens.
Iris: It is the coloured part of the eye. It may be 
blue, brown or green in colour. Every person 
has a unique colour, pattern and texture. Iris 
controls amount of light entering into the 
pupil like camera aperture.
Pupil: It is the centre part of the Iris. It is the 
pathway for the light to retina.
Retina: This is the back surface of the eye. It is 
the most sensitive part of human eye, on which 
real and inverted image of objects is formed. 
Ciliary muscles – Eye lens is fixed between 
the ciliary muscles. It helps to change the focal 
length of the eye lens according to the position 
of the object.
Eye Lens – It is the important part of human 
eye. It is convex in nature.

Figure 2.15 Human eye
Working of the eye
The transparent layer cornea bends the 
light rays through pupil located at the centre 
part of the Iris. The adjusted light passes 
through the eye lens. Eye lens is convex in 
nature. So, the light rays from the objects 
are converged and a real and inverted image 
is formed on retina.  Then, retina passes the 
received real and inverted image to the brain 
through optical nerves. Finally, the brain 
senses it as erect image.
Power of Accommodation
The ability of the eye lens to focus nearby 
as well as the distant objects is called power of 
accommodation of the eye. This is achieved by 
changing the focal length of the eye lens with 
the help of ciliary muscles. 
Eye lens is made of a flexible, jelly-like 
material. By relaxing and contracting the ciliary 
muscle, the curvature and hence the focal 
length of the eye lens can be altered. When we 
see distant objects, the ciliary muscle relaxes 
and makes the eye lens thinner. This increases 
the focal length of the eye lens. Hence, the 
distant object can be clearly seen. On the other 
hand, when we look at a closer object, the 
focal length of the eye lens is decreased by the 
contraction of ciliary muscle. Thus, the image 
of the closer object is clearly formed on the 
retina. 
Persistence of vision
If 
the 
time 
interval 
between 
two 
consecutive light pulses is less than 0.1 second, 
human eye cannot distinguish them separately. 
It is called persistence of vision.
The far point and near point of 
the human eye
The minimum distance required to see the 
objects distinctly without strain is called least 
distance of distinct vision. It is called as near 
point of eye. It is 25 cm for normal human eye.
10th_Science_Unit-2.indd   24
21-02-2019   18:34:38

25
Optics
Th e maximum distance up to which the 
eye can see objects clearly is called as far point 
of the eye. It is infi nity for normal eye.
 2.17  DEFECTS IN EYE
A normal human eye can clearly see all 
the objects placed between 25cm and infi nity. 
But, for some people, the eye loses its power 
of accommodation. Th is could happen due to 
many reasons including ageing. Hence, their 
vision becomes defective. Let us discuss some 
of the common defects of human eye. 
Myopia
Myopia, also known as short sightedness, 
occurs due to the lengthening of eye ball. With 
this defect, nearby objects can be seen clearly 
but distant objects cannot be seen clearly. Th e 
focal length of eye lens is reduced or the distance 
between eye lens and retina increases. Hence, 
the far point will not be infi nity for such eyes 
and the far point has come closer. Due to this, 
the image of distant objects are formed before 
the retina (Figure 2.16-a). Th is defect can be 
corrected using a concave lens (Figure 2.16-b). 
Th e focal length of the concave lens to be used 
is computed as follows: 
Figure 2.16  (a) Vision with myopia 
b) Corrected vision using a concave lens
(a) Myopia
(b) Myopia corrected eye
Let a person with myopia eye can see up
to a distance x. Suppose that he wants to see 
all objects farther than this distance, i.e., up to 
infi nity. Th en the focal length of the required 
concave lens is f = –x. If the person can see 
up to a distance x and he wants to see up to a 
distance y, then, the focal length of the required 
concave lens is,
f =    xy
 x−y  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .(2.7)
Hypermeteropia
Hypermeteropia, also known as long 
sightedness, occurs due to the shortening of 
eye ball. With this defect, distant objects can 
be seen clearly but nearby objects cannot be 
seen clearly. Th e focal length of eye lens is 
increased or the distance between eye lens 
and retina decreases. Hence, the near point 
will not be at 25cm for such eyes and the 
near point has moved farther. Due to this, the 
image of nearby objects are formed behind 
the retina (Figure 2.17-a). Th is defect can be 
corrected using a convex lens (Figure 2.17-b). 
Th e focal length of the convex lens to be used 
is computed as follows: 
Figure 2.17  (a) Vision with hypermeteropia  
(b) Corrected vision using a convex lens
Let a person with hypermeteropia eye can 
see object beyond a distance d. Suppose that he 
wants to see all objects closer than this distance 
up to a distance D. Th en, the focal length of the 
required convex lens is
f =    dD  
 d−D 
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . .(2.8)
Presbyopia
Due to ageing, ciliary muscles become 
weak and the eye-lens become rigid (infl exible) 
andso the eye loses its power of accommodation.
Because of this, an aged person cannot see 
the nearby objects clearly. So, it is also called as 
‘old age hypermetropia’.
10th_Science_Unit-2.indd   25
21-02-2019   18:34:38

26
10th Standard Science
Some persons may have both the defects 
of vision - myopia as well as hypermetropia. 
This can be corrected by ‘bifocal lenses’. In 
which, upper part consists of concave lens (to 
correct myopia) used for distant vision and the 
lower part consists of convex lens (to correct 
hypermetropia) used for reading purposes.
Astigmatism
In this defect, eye cannot see parallel and 
horizontal lines clearly. It may be inherited or 
acquired. It is due to the imperfect structure of 
eye lens because of the development of cataract 
on the lens, ulceration of cornea, injury to the 
refracting surfaces, etc. Astigmatism can be 
corrected by using cylindrical lenses (Torrid 
lenses).
 2.18  MICROSCOPE
This is an optical instrument, which helps 
us to see tiny (very small) objects. It is classified 
as 
1. Simple microscope
2. Compound microscope
Simple Microscope
Simple microscope has a convex lens of 
short focal length. It is held near the eye to get 
enlarged image of small objects.
Let an object (AB) is placed at a point 
within the principal focus (u < f) of the convex 
lens and the observer’s eye is placed just behind 
the lens. As per this position the convex lens 
produces an erect, virtual and enlarged image 
(A'B'). The image formed is in the same side of 
the object and the distance equal to the least 
distance of distinct vision (D) (For normal 
human eye D = 25 cm).
Uses of Simple microscope
Simple microscopes are used 
a) by watch repairers and jewellers.
b) to read small letters clearly.
c) to observe parts of flower, insects etc.
d) to observe finger prints in the field of
forensic science.
Compound microscope
Compound microscope is also used to 
see the tiny objects. It has better magnification 
power than simple microscope.
Magnification power of microscopes 
can be increased by decreasing the focal 
length of the lens used. Due to constructional 
limitations, the focal length of the lens cannot 
be decreased beyond certain limit. This 
problem can be solved by using two separate 
biconvex lenses. 
Construction
A compound microscope consists of two 
convex lenses. The lens with the shorter focal 
length is placed near the object, and is called 
as ‘objective lens’ or ‘objective piece’. The lens 
with larger focal length and larger aperture 
placed near the observer’s eye is called as ‘eye 
lens’ or ‘eye piece’.  Both the lenses are fixed in 
a narrow tube with adjustable provision.
Working
The object (AB) is placed  at a distance 
slightly greater than the focal length of 
objective lens (u > fo). A real, inverted and 
magnified image (A'B') is formed at the other

side of the objective lens. This image behaves 
as the object for the eye lens. The position of 
the eye lens is adjusted in such a way, that the 
image (A'B') falls within the principal focus of 
the eye piece.  This eye piece forms a virtual, 
enlarged and erect image (A" B") on the same 
side of the object
Compound microscope has 50 to 200 
times more magnification power than simple 
microscope
Travelling Microscope
A travelling microscope is one of the best 
instrument for measuring very small length 
with high degree of accuracy at the order of 
0.01mm.  It works based on the principle of 
vernier. Its least count is 0.01 mm.
 2.19  TELESCOPE
Have you seen the recent lunar eclipse? 
With our naked eye we can’t visualize the 
phenomena distinctly. Then, how can we see 
the distant object in clearer manner? It is 
possible with telescope.
Telescope is an optical instrument to see 
the distant objects. The first telescope was 
invented by Johann Lippershey in 1608. Galileo 
made a telescope to observe distant stars. He 
got the idea, from a spectacle maker who one 
day observed that the distant weather cock 
appeared magnified through his lens system 
fitted in his shop. Galileo observed the satellites 
of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn through 
his telescope. Kepler invented Telescope in 
1611 which was fundamentally similar to the 
astronomical telescope. 
Types of Telescope
According to optical property, it is 
classified into two groups: 
i) refracting telescope ii) reflecting telescope
In refracting telescope lenses are used. 
Galilean 
telescope, 
Keplerian 
telescope, 
Achromatic refractors, are some refracting 
telescopes.
In reflecting telescope parabolic mirrors 
are used Gregorian, Newtonian, Cassegrain 
telescope are some Reflecting telescopes
According to the things which are 
observed, 
Astronomical 
Telescope 
and 
Terrestrial Telescopes are the two major types 
of telescope.
Astronomical Telescope
An astronomical telescope is used to view 
heavenly bodies like stars, planets galaxies and 
satellites.
Terrestrial Telescopes
The image in an astronomical telescope 
is inverted. So, it is not suitable for viewing 
objects on the surface of the Earth. Therefore, 
a terrestrial telescope is used. It provides an 
erect image. The major difference between 
astronomical and terrestrial telescope is 
erecting the final image with respect to the 
object.
Advantages of Telescopes
•
Elaborate view of the Galaxies, Planets, stars
and other heavenly bodies is possible.
•
Camera can be attached for taking
photograph for the celestial objects.
•
Telescope can be viewed even with the low
intensity of light.
Disadvantages
•
Frequent maintenances needed.
•
It is not easily portable one.

INTRODUCTION 
Sun is the primary source of thermal 
energy for all living organisms. Thermal 
energy is the cause and temperature is the 
effect. All living organisms need a particular 
temperature for their survival. In the kitchen, 
a container with a steel bottom is placed on 
the induction stove. Do you know why? All 
of us have a common man’s understanding of 
thermal energy and temperature. But, in this 
chapter, you shall learn about thermal energy 
and temperature in a scientific manner. We 
shall also discuss about how thermal energy 
is transferred and the effects of thermal 
energy.
 3.1   TEMPERATURE
Temperature is defined as the degree 
of hotness of a body. The temperature is 
higher for a hotter body than for a colder 
body. It is also be defined as the property 
which determines whether a body is in 
equilibrium or not with the surroundings.  
(or average kinetic enegy of the molecules). 
Further, temperature is the property, which 
determines the direction of flow of heat. It is 
a scalar quantity. The SI unit of temperature 
is kelvin (K). There are other commonly 
used units of temperature such as degree 
celsius (°C) and degree fahrenheit (°F).
3.1.1  Absolute scale (kelvin scale) 
of temperature
The temperature measured in relation to 
absolute zero using the kelvin scale is known 
as absolute temperature. It is also known as 
the thermodynamic temperature. Each unit 
of the thermodynamic scale of temperature is 
defined as the fraction of 1/273.16th part of the 
thermodynamic temperature of the triple point 
of water. A temperature difference of 1°C is equal 
to that of 1K. Zero Kelvin is the absolute scale 
of tempeture  of the body.

Thermal Physics
The relation between the different types 
of scale of temperature:
Celsius and Kelvin: K = C + 273,
Fahrenheit and Kelvin: [K] = (F + 460) ×  5
 9
  0 K = –273°C.
3.1.2  Thermal equilibrium
Two or more physical systems or bodies are 
said to be in thermal equilibrium if there is no 
net flow of thermal energy between the systems. 
Heat energy always flows from one body to 
the other due to a temperature difference 
between them. Thus, you can define thermal 
equilibrium in another way. If two bodies are 
said to be in thermal equilibrium, then, they 
will be at the same temperature. What will 
happen if two bodies at different temperatures 
are brought in contact with one other? There 
will be a transfer of heat energy from the 
hot body to the cold body until a thermal 
equilibrium is established between them. This 
is depicted in Figure 3.1.
Figure 3.1 Establishing thermal equilibrium
When a cold body is placed in contact with 
a hot body, some thermal energy is transferred 
from the hot body to the cold body. As a result, 
there is some rise in the temperature of the cold 
body and decrease in the temperature of the 
hot body. This process will continue until these 
two bodies attain the same temperature.
 3.2  THERMAL ENERGY
If you leave a cup of hot milk on a table for 
some time, what happens? The hotness of the 
milk decreases after some time. Similarly, if you 
keep a bottle of cold water on a table, the water 
becomes warmer after some time. What do you 
infer from these observations? In the case of hot 
milk, there is a flow of energy from the cup of 
milk to the environment. In the second case, 
the energy is transferred from the environment 
to the water bottle. This energy is termed as 
“thermal energy”. 
When a hot object is in contact with 
another cold object, a form of energy flows from 
the hot object to the cold object, which is known 
as thermal energy. Thus, thermal energy is a 
form of energy which is transferred between 
any two bodies due to the difference in their 
temperatures. Thermal energy is also known as 
'heat energy' or simply 'heat'.
Heat energy is the agent, which produces 
the sensation of warmth and makes bodies hot. 
The process in which heat energy flows from a 
body at a higher temperature to another object 
at lower temperature is known as heating. This 
process of transmission of heat may be done 
in any of the ways like conduction, convection 
or radiation. Heat is a scalar quantity. The SI 
unit of heat energy absorbed or evolved is 
joule (J) . 
During the process of transferring heat 
energy, the body at lower temperature is heated 
while the body at higher temperature is cooled. 
Thus, sometimes, this process of transfer of 
heat energy is termed as 'cooling'. But, in 
most of the cases the term 'heating' is used 
instead of 'cooling'. When the thermal energy 
is transferred from one body to another, this 
results in the rise or lowering of the temperature 
of either of the bodies. 
3.2.1  Characteristic features 
of heat energy transfer
1. Heat always flows from a system at
higher temperature to a system at lower
temperature.
2. The mass of a system is not altered when it is
heated or cooled.
3. For any exchange of heat, the heat gained by
the cold system is equal to heat lost by the
hot system. Heat gained = Heat lost

3.2.2  Other units of Heat energy
Though the SI unit of heat energy is joule, 
there are some other commonly used units. 
Calorie: One calorie is defined as the amount of 
heat energy required to rise the temperature of 1 
gram of water through 1°C.
Kilocalorie: One kilocalorie is defined as the 
amount of heat energy required to rise the 
temperature of 1 kilogram of water through 1°C.
 3.3  EFFECT OF HEAT ENERGY
When a certain amount of heat energy 
is given to a substance, it will undergo one or 
more of the following changes:
•
Temperature of the substance rises.
•
 The substance may change its state from
solid to liquid or from liquid to gas.
•
The substance will expand when heated.
The rise in temperature is in proportion
to the amount of heat energy supplied. It 
also depends on the nature and mass of the 
substance. About the rise in temperature 
and the change of state, you have studied in 
previous classes. In the following section, we 
shall discuss about the expansion of substances 
due to heat.
3.3.1  Expansion of Substances
When heat energy is supplied to a body, 
there can be an increase in the dimension of 
the object. This change in 
the dimension due to rise 
in temperature is called 
thermal expansion of the 
object. The expansion of 
liquids (e.g. mercury) can be 
seen when a thermometer 
is placed in warm water. All forms of matter 
(solid, liquid and gas) undergo expansion on 
heating.
a) Expansion in solids
When a solid is heated, the atoms gain
energy and vibrate more vigorously. This results 
in the expansion of the solid. For a given change 
in temperature, the extent of expansion is smaller 
in solids than in liquids and gases. This is due to 
the rigid nature of solids. 
The different types of expansion of solid are 
listed and explained below:
1. Linear expansion
2. Superficial expansion
3. Cubical expansion
1. Linear expansion:
When a body is heated or cooled, the
length of the body changes due to change in 
its temperature. Then the expansion is said to 
be linear or longitudinal expansion.
The ratio of increase in length of the body 
per degree rise in temperature to its unit length 
is called as the coefficient of linear expansion. 
The SI unit of Coefficient of Linear expansion is 
K-1. The value of coefficient of linear expansion 
is different for different materials.
Figure 3.2 Linear expansion
The equation relating the change in length 
and the change in temperature of a body is 
given below:

Thermal Physics
2. Superficial expansion:
If there is an increase in the area of a solid
object due to heating, then the expansion is 
called superficial or areal expansion.
Superficial expansion  is determined in 
terms of coefficient of superficial expansion. 
The ratio of increase in area of the body per 
degree rise in temperature to its unit area is 
called as coefficient of superficial expansion. 
Coefficient of superficial expansion is different 
for different materials. The SI unit of Coefficient 
of superficial expansion is K-1
The equation relating to the changein area 
and the change in temperature is given below:

area)

3. Cubical expansion:
If there is an increase in the volume of a
solid body due to heating, then the expansion 
is called cubical or volumetric expansion.
As in the cases of linear and areal expansion, 
cubical expansion is also expressed in terms of 
coefficient of cubical expansion. The ratio of 
increase in volume of the body per degree rise 
in temperature to its unit volume is called as 
coefficient of cubical expansion. This is also 
measured in K
–1.

and the change in temperature is given below:

materials 
possess 
different 
coefficient of cubical expansion. Table 3.1 gives

common materials.

b) Expansion in liquids and gases
When heated, the atoms in a liquid or gas
gain energy and are forced further apart. The 
extent of expansion varies from substance to 
substance. For a given rise in temperature, a 
liquid will have more expansion than a solid 
and a gaseous substance has the highest 
expansion when compared with the other two. 
The coefficient of cubical expansion of liquid is 
independent of temperature whereas its value 
for gases depends on the temperature of gases.

10th Standard Science
When a liquid is heated, it is done by keeping 
the liquid in some container and supplying heat 
energy to the liquid through the container. The 
thermal energy supplied will be partly used 
in expanding the container and partly used in 
expanding the liquid. Thus, what we observe 
may not be the actual or real expansion of the 
liquid. Hence, for liquids, we can define real 
expansion and apparent expansion.
1) Real expansion
If a liquid is heated directly without using
any container, then the expansion that you observe 
is termed as real expansion of the liquid. 
Coefficient of real expansion is defined 
as the ratio of the true rise in the volume of 
the liquid per degree rise in temperature to its 
unit volume. The SI unit of coefficient of real 
expansion is K
–1.
2) Apparent expansion
Heating a liquid without using a container
is not possible. Thus, in practice, you can heat 
any liquid by pouring it in a container. A part 
of thermal energy is used in expanding the 
container and a part is used in expanding the 
liquid. Thus, what you observe is not the actual 
or real expansion of the liquid. The expansion 
of a liquid apparently observed without 
considering the expansion of the container is 
called the apparent expansion of the liquid. 
Coefficient of apparent expansion is 
defined as the ratio of the apparent rise in 
the volume of the liquid per degree rise in 
temperature to its unit volume. The SI unit of 
coefficient of apparent expansion is K
–1.
3.3.2  Experiment to measure real 
and apparent expansion 
of liquid
To start with, the liquid whose real and 
apparent expansion is to be determined is 
poured in a container up to a level. Mark this 
level as L1. Now, heat the container and the 
liquid using a burner as shown in the Figure 3.5. 
Initially, the container receives the thermal 
energy and it expands. As a result, the volume 
of the liquid appears to have reduced. Mark this 
reduced level of liquid as L2. 
On further heating, the thermal energy 
supplied to the liquid through the container 
results in the expansion of the liquid. Hence, 
the level of liquid rises to L3. Now, the difference 
between the levels L1 and L3 is called as apparent 
expansion, and the difference between the levels 
L2 and L3 is called real expansion. The real 
expansion is always more than that of apparent 
expansion.
Figure 3.5 Real and apparent expansion 
of liquid
Real expansion = L3 – L2
Apparent expansion = L3 – L1
 3.4   FUNDAMENTAL LAWS 
OF GASES
The three fundamental laws which 
connect the relation between pressure, volume 
and temperature are as follows:
1) Boyle’s Law
2) Charles's law 
3) Avogadro's law
3.4.1 Boyle’s law:  
When the temperature of a gas is kept 
constant, the volume of a fixed mass of gas is 
inversely proportional to its pressure. This is 
shown in Figure 3.6.      
P α 1/V

37
Thermal Physics
Figure 3.6 Variation of volume with pressure
In other words, for an invariable mass 
of a perfect gas, at constant temperature, 
the product of its pressure and volume is a 
constant.
(i.e)  PV = constant
3.4.2  Charles's law 
(The law of volume)
Charles’s law was formulated by a French 
scientist Jacques Charles. According to this 
law, When the pressure of gas is kept constant, 
the volume of a gas is directly proportional to 
the temperature of the gas.
V α T
or V
 T = constant
3.4.3  Avogadro's law 
Avogadro's law states 
that at constant pressure and 
temperature, the volume of a 
gas is directly proportional 
to number of atoms or 
molecules present in it.
i.e.      V α n
(or)      V
 n = constant
Avogadro’s number (NA) is the total 
number of atoms per mole of the substance. It 
is equal to 6.023 × 10
23 /mol.
 3.5  GASES
Gases are classified as real gases and 
ideal gases.
3.5.1 Real Gases 
If the molecules or atoms of a gases 
interact with each other with a definite amount 
of intermolecular or inter atomic force of 
attraction, then the gases are said to be real 
gases. At very high temperature or low pressure, 
a real gases behaves as an ideal gases because 
in this condition there is no interatomic or 
intermolecular force of attraction.
3.5.2 Ideal Gases
If the atoms or molecules of a gas do not 
interact with each other, then the gas is said to 
be an ideal gas or a perfect gas. 
Actually, in practice, no gas is ideal. 
The molecules of any gas will have a certain 
amount of interaction among them. But, these 
interactions are weaker when the pressure 
is low or the temperature is high because 
the interatomic or intermolecular forces of 
attraction are weak in ideal gas. Hence, a real 
gas at low pressure or high temperature can be 
termed as a perfect gas.
Ideal gases obey Boyle’s law, Charles’s law 
and Avogadro’s law. All these laws state the 
relationship between various properties of a gas 
such as pressure (P), volume (V), temperature 
(T) and number of atoms (n). In a given state of
the gas, all these parameters will have a definite
set of values. When there is a change in the state
of the gas, any one or more of these parameters
change its value. The above said laws relate these
changes.
3.5.3 Ideal Gas Equation
The ideal gas equation is an equation, 
which relates all the properties of an ideal gas. 
An ideal gas obeys Boyle’s law and Charles’ law 
and Avogadro’s law. According to Boyle’s law,

According to Charles’s law, 
V/T = constant  
(3.2)
According to Avogadro’s law,
V/n = constant  
 (3.3)
After combining equations (3.1), (3.2) 
and (3.3), you can get the following equation.
PV/nT = constant 
(3.4)
The above relation is called the combined 
law of gases. If you consider a gas, which 
contains µ moles of the gas, the number of 
atoms contained will be equal to µ times the 
Avogadro number, NA. 
i.e.   n = µNA.
(3.5)
Using equation (3.5), equation (3.4) can 
be written as
PV/ µNAT = constant
The value of the constant in the above 
equation is taken to be kB, which is called as 
Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10–23 JK–1). Hence, 
we have the following equation:
PV/ µNAT = kB
PV = µNA kB T
Here, µNAkB = R, which is termed as 
universal gas constant whose value is 
8.31 J mol−1 K−1. 
PV = RT  
 (3.6)
Ideal gas equation is also called as equation 
of state because it gives the relation between 
the state variables and it is used to describe the 
state of any gas.
Points to Remember

 The SI unit of heat energy absorbed or
evolved is joule (J)

 Heat always flows from a system at higher
temperature to a system at lower temperature.

 Temperature is defined as the degree
of hotness of a body. The SI unit of
temperature is kelvin (K).

 All the substances will undergo one or
more of the following changes when
heated:
i)
 Temperature of the substance rises.
ii)
 The substance may change state from
solid to liquid or gas.
iii)  The 
substance 
will 
expand
when heated.

 All forms of matter (solid, liquid and gas)
undergo expansion on heating.

 For a given rise in temperature, a liquid
will have more expansion than a solid
and a gaseous substance has the highest
expansion than the other two.

 If a liquid is heated directly without using
any container, then the expansion that
you observe is termed as real expansion
of the liquid.

 The expansion of a liquid apparently
observed 
without 
considering 
the
expansion of the container is called the
apparent expansion of liquid.

 For a given heat energy, the real expansion
is always more than that of apparent
expansion.

 If the atoms or molecules of a gas do
not interact with each other, then
the gas is said to be an ideal gas or a
perfect gas.

 Ideal gas equation, also called as equation
of state is PV = RT. Here, R is known as
universal gas constant whose value is
8.31 J mol
−1K

Solved Problems
Example 1
A container whose capacity is 70 ml is 
filled with a liquid up to 50 ml. Then, the 
liquid in the container is heated. Initially, the 
level of the liquid falls from 50 ml to 48.5 ml. 
Then we heat more, the level of the liquid 
rises to 51.2 ml. Find the apparent and real 
expansion.

Thermal Physics
Data:
Level of the liquid L1 = 50 ml
Level of the liquid L2 = 48.5 ml
Level of the liquid L3 = 51.2 ml
Apparent expansion  = L3 − L1
= 51.2 ml – 50 ml 
= 1.2ml
Real expansion  = L3 − L1
= 51.2 ml – 48.5ml 
= 2.7ml
So, Real expansion > apparent expansion
Example 2
Keeping the temperature as constant, 
a gas is compressed four times of its initial 
pressure. The volume of gas in the container 
changing from 20cc (V1 cc) to V2 cc. Find the 
final volume V2.
Data:
Initial pressure (P1)= P
Final Pressure (P2) = 4P
Initial volume (V1) = 20cc = 20cm3
Final volume (V2) = ?
Using Boyle's Law, PV = constant
P1V1 = P2V2
V2 = P1
P2
× V1
= P
4P × 20cm3
V2 = 5 cm3
